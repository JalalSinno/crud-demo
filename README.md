# Starwars Quote app
This is an app that will allow you to add and replace Yoda quotes with Darth Vader quotes

![Picutre of the project. Contents include title, add yoda quote, remove a quote, replace a yoda quote and a list of all the quotes](/pictureofapp.png)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, MongoDB, and CRUD

Built the front end with HTML, the styling with CSS. Stored the quotes in a MongoDB database and used Node to communicate to the DB.

## Optimizations
Add more color to the application.
Make it so that you can replace any quote
Make stricter restrictions on what can be passed through the forms to ensure both forms are filled with content before submission

## Lessons Learned:
Solidified understanding of CRUD operations. Worked with CSS more to familiarize myself with flexbox.
